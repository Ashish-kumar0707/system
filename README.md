 Introduction To The Project: 
 
The development of music recommendation systems using ontologies and web semantics has gained 
significant attention in recent years. By analyzing user preferences, behavior, and past listening 
habits, these systems suggest songs, albums, or artists to users that align with their individual 
preferences. In this project, we have designed a music recommendation system that recommends 
popular songs based on a chosen genre or artist using their popularity score. Our system is able to 
identify patterns and provide personalized recommendations that enhance the listening experience 
for music lovers. 
 
 
Problem Statement & Objective:  
 
With the ever-increasing music options available, a personalized music recommendation system is 
necessary. We developed an ontology-based music recommender using Protege, Celfie plug-in 
which we used in protege, and Apache Jena Fuseki, and implementing it with Flask and web 
technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This system will capture the complex relationships 
between different music genres, styles, and moods, and provide users with personalized and diverse 
music recommendations based on their individual preferences.
